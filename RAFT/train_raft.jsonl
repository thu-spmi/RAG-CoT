Participants are required to be Pennsylvania high school students between their junior and senior years and are required to live in the dormitories for the full five weeks of the program.  Admission is very competitive - approximately 500 of the most scientifically gifted students in the state compete for 56 to 60 slots in the program.  The aim of PGSS is to promote interest in science rather than to advance students' knowledge in a specific area.  The curriculum includes five \"core\" courses in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics, and numerous electives.  In addition to taking classes, students are required to participate in a lab course and a research-style team project.  The emphasis is on cooperation, rather than competition - students are encouraged to both collaborate with other students on academic work and to interact socially.  The Residence Life staff provides a number of structured social events to foster friendship and teamwork.  There is at least one event per day and is advertised on the social calendar in the dorm lobby.  For many students, the social development gained from the program rivals the scientific knowledge they acquire.  The students leave the program with a strong bond; most attend an organized reunion the following year after the 4th week of the program.", "Murderball is a 2005 American documentary film about athletes who are physically disabled who play wheelchair rugby.

The first observation was influenced by Herbert A. Simon's parable of the two watchmakers—in which Simon concludes that complex systems evolve from simple systems much more rapidly when there are stable intermediate forms present in the evolutionary process than if they are not present.  The second observation was made by Koestler himself in his analysis of hierarchies and stable intermediate forms in non-living matter (atomic and molecular structure), living organisms, and social organizations.  He concluded that, although it is easy to identify sub-wholes or parts, wholes and parts in an absolute sense do not exist anywhere.  Koestler proposed the word holon to describe the hybrid nature of sub-wholes and parts within in vivo systems.  From this perspective, holons exist simultaneously as self-contained wholes in relation to their sub-ordinate parts, and as dependent parts when considered from the inverse direction."]}

It was a new means of attaching an engine to its chassis, with the intention of reducing vibration.  Four-cylinder engines of the day started and rode rather roughly, transmitting the torque to the whole chassis.  By attaching the engine at only two points (\"fore-and-aft\"), on two points defining an axis that passes through the engine's center of mass, the engine would be able to rotate slightly about this axis and reduce the transmission of torsional vibration to the chassis.  One mounting attachment was at the upper front of the engine, directly below the water pump.  The rear mount was under the transmission case.  A transverse spring went from the bottom of the engine to a snubber bracket on the frame rail to limit the rotational travel of the engine.  The bracket was lined with rubber.", "The Detroit Diesel Series 51 was a two-stroke diesel engine built by General Motors, Detroit Diesel Division from 1951 to 1959.  Unlike other GM/Detroit Diesel engines, the 51 series designation did not refer to the cylinder displacement, but rather to the year it was introduced.  Two versions were produced, an inline two-cylinder (2-51, 108 cid ) and an inline four-cylinder model (4-51, 216 cid ).  This was accomplished by using loop scavenging ports for both intake and exhaust along with a mechanical blower.  This engine used a dry sleeve with 9 intake ports and three exhaust ports in that sleeve.  These sleeves were located in such a way that the exhaust ports lined up with exhaust ports in the block that were physically higher than the intake ports in the block.  This resulted in pressurized cool air being forced through the intake ports just after the exhaust started exiting (note that the exhaust ports in the sleeves were higher at the top than the intake ports while the bottom of all ports in the sleeve are at the same height.  The net compression ratio is 18:1.  Unlike a two cycle gasoline engine, the crankcase was not used to draw in the fuel/air mixture.  Instead, the blower forced air in the intake ports and fuel was injected by a camshaft actuated injector which was pressurized by a gear pump.  As fuel is injected just before top dead center, little unburned fuel is expelled in the exhaust, unlike a two-cycle gasoline engine.  The elimination of exhaust valves reduced the complexity and weight of the engine.  The power output and RPM of this engine was controlled by governing the intake air and controlling the opening of the injectors with shutdown accomplished by completely closing off the air intake.  The much lower weight of this engine compared to engines with valves made it quite suitable for applications where other engines of the same horsepower were not feasible.  Its uses include: Marine propulsion, generators, pumps, air compressors, road graders and other industrial uses.  It was never factory installed for automotive purposes but conversion kits and engines were made available for automotive use.  This engine design did not see widespread use due to not being able to reduce the exhaust noise to an acceptable level, as any exhaust restriction would have resulted in a reduction of power and efficiency.  It was a very fuel efficient engine with a high power output to fuel consumption ratio.", "Femap (\"Finite Element Modeling And Postprocessing\") is an engineering analysis program sold by Siemens PLM Software that is used to build finite element models of complex engineering problems (\"pre-processing\") and view solution results (\"post-processing\").

The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries.
